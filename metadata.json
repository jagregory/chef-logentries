Unfortunately, when you install the `logentries-daemon` package it immediately tries to start the agent and will fail if you haven't pre-configured your host settings; this is problematic in a Chef script, because we haven't had an opportunity to set things up yet.\n\nTo solve this problem, the commandline tools are installed immediately, then the `logentries-daemon` package will only be installed at the end of your chef run; it will be triggered by the use of any of the `logentries` definitions.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
